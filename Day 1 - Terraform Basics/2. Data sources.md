# Data Source

Data sources in Terraform are used to get information about resources external to Terraform, and use them to set up your Terraform resources. For example, a list of IP addresses a cloud provider exposes. Data sources serve as a bridge between the current infrastructure and the desired configuration, allowing for more dynamic and context-aware provisioning.

## Creating a VPC manually

We will create a VPC manually. Now we have created a IGW using TF, and we want to attach this IGW to our manually created VPC. This can be achieved using data source.

Search - data source vpc terraform

```
data "aws_vpc" "<manual-vpc-name>" {
  id = "vpc-01fb7b7e6dfa92c9b"
}
```
